Economic Growth - Lecture 4
\end_layout

\begin_layout Author

\begin_layout Section
Endogenous Growth - Continued
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The main conclusions form the endogenous growth model we seen last week
 is that R&D is the main driver of the growth.
 The investment is an endogenous factor, by firms which try to maximize
 profit.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The scale effect - the larger is the economy, the more R&D is (the marginal
 cost is 0, and there is only the fixed cost of innovation).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The crucial element is that technology is non-rival and excludable.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The number of new innovations each firm produces is a multiple of the innovation
s in the previous period.
 Monopolistic competition might lead to too much / not enough investment.
 There is an externality to technology, as it might generate under-investment
 in R&D.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Criticism
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We did not understand 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

too much
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 about economic growth yet, but only 
\series bold
assumed
\series default
 that R&D drives it.
 The model only tells us that there are factors that create 
\series bold
incentives
\series default
 for investment in R&D.
 The Romer model doesn't really help in explaining the economic growth of
 the last centuries.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When it comes to real data, this model is very bad at predicting.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Jones critisicm:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Economies of scale - there is no increase of innovation, no supporting data.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Non-decreasing productivity in R&D: the assumption is a linear (non diminishing
 MP of R&D).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
New technology is proportional to the stock of old technology.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Define 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma_{t}$
\end_inset

 as the change in productivity:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\gamma_{t}\equiv\frac{\Delta A_{t}}{A_{t}}=\frac{A_{t+1}-A_{t}}{A_{t}}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Suppose 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{t+1}=A_{t}+\Delta A_{t}=[1+g(R\&D)]A_{t}$
\end_inset

 with R&D being constant over time, then the growth rate is constant as
 well.
 Then, 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta A_{t}=g(R\&D)A_{t}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What if 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta\neq1$
\end_inset

? Then, 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta A_{t}=g(R\&D)A_{t}^{\beta}$
\end_inset

.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta>1$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma_{t}$
\end_inset

 converges to infinity, when 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta<1$
\end_inset

 is converges to 0.
 As 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta A_{t}$
\end_inset

 is 
\series bold
proportional
\series default
 to 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{t}$
\end_inset

, the growth rate is 
\series bold
constant
\series default
.
 This simplifying assumption is not necessary true in reality.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Galor-Zeira Model
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Solow model and the R&D model establish macro growth models with representat
ive agents.
 The next stage is to discuss additional mechanisms that affect growth â€“
 inequality (heterogeneity) being one of them.
 A related topic is poverty traps - which can be discussed using this model
 as well.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Growth and development are similar but no the same - growth usually refers
 to rich countries, while development usually talks about poorer ones.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The production function is very simple:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
Y_{t}=w^{u}L_{t}+w^{s}H_{t}
\]

\end_inset

There are 2 types of workers (skilled and unskilled).
 Unskilled workers become skilled by acquiring education.
 Individuals live in overlapping generaions.
 A generation is born every period and lives for 2 periods, with each individual
 having exactly one parent and one child (e.g someone who makes a decision
 whether to go to college).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the first life period individuals get endowments from their parents,
 They invest it either in human capital or physical capital.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the second period they supply labor inelastically, consume and bequeath.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Informally speaking, parents give children money and they use it (in practice,
 parents decide for their offspring).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Preferences are defined by the utility function:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
u_{t}^{i}=(1-\beta)logc_{t+1}^{i}+\beta logb_{t+1}^{i}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
meaning, young individuals do not consume anything (they are 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

with the parents
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

), therefore they only maximize 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

future utility
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 The decision today is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

how to invest (and allocate capital) in order to maximize 
\series bold
future
\series default
 utility
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The budget constraint is:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
c_{t+1}+b_{t+1}^{i}=I_{t+1}^{i}\Rightarrow b_{t+1}^{i}=b(I_{t+1}^{i})=\beta I_{t+1}^{i}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This utility models 
\series bold
altruism
\series default
 (
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

the joy of giving
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

) in a very simple way.
 Formally speaking, parents do not 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

care
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 about the resulting utility, but only want to give money to their children.
 The essence of this model is capturing the 
\series bold
family ties
\series default
: rich parents give more money to their children, to invest in human capital,
 which increases and get transferred to the next generation, etc...
 - which is a poverty trap when considering a poor family.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is a cost 
\begin_inset Formula $h$
\end_inset

 invested in 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 to become skilled in 
\begin_inset Formula $t+1$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The gross interest rate for lenders is 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

, and the gross interest rate for borrowers for human capital investment
 is 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta R$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta>1$
\end_inset

 (market imperfection - the larger is 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

 - the more there are market imperfections and credit constraints).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Assumptions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
\begin_inset Formula $w^{s}-w^{u}$
\end_inset

 is large enough, so that 
\begin_inset Formula $w^{s}-s^{u}>hR$
\end_inset

 (becoming a skilled worker is reasonable and profitable).
 Suppose someone has enough money to invest in human capital - the gap resulting
 from the gain is big enough to justify it, rather than investing in physical
 capital.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

 is large enough, so that 
\begin_inset Formula $w^{s}-w^{u}<h\theta R$
\end_inset

 - a person who does not have enough money to invest in human capital won't
 take a loan, as the income gap is not big enough.

i.
 when an individual does 
\series bold
not
\series default
 have enough money, she chooses between taking a loan and investing in physical
 capital.
 There exists a 
\series bold
unique
\series default
 threshold 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{b}$
\end_inset

, which differentiates between the 2 options.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The dynamical system is given by:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left\{ \begin{array}{c}
\beta[w^{u}+b_{t}^{i}R]\,\,\,(b_{t}^{i}<\hat{b})\\
\beta[w^{s}+(h-b_{t}^{i})\theta R]\,\,\,b\in[\hat{b},h)\\
\beta[w^{s}+(b_{t}^{i}-h)\theta R]\,\,\,b_{t}^{i}\geq h
\end{array}\right\} 
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are 2 locally stable steady states, separated by a threshold inbetween;
 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{b}$
\end_inset

 separates the investment, while 
\begin_inset Formula $b^{T}$
\end_inset

 is the long-run thresholds (between them there is a range in which there
 is a short-run return, but it is not enough no escape poverty - which leads
 eventually to a convergence to poverty).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is not a poverty trap of a 
\series bold
country
\series default
, but of 
\series bold
individuals
\series default
.
 At the individual level, there are 3 steady states, 2 of which are stable.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Looking at the whole economy rather than at a single individual, there are
 infinitely many steady states (assuming a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

continuous
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 population).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Assumption 3: 
\begin_inset Formula $w^{s}$
\end_inset

 is sufficiently large (such that 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta w^{s}>h$
\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Assumption 4: 
\begin_inset Formula $s^{u}$
\end_inset

 is sufficiently small (
\begin_inset Formula $s^{u}<\hat{b}(1/\beta-R)\Leftrightarrow\beta R<1$
\end_inset

)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Conclusion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The above assumptions 
\series bold
guarantee
\series default
 the generation of a poverty trap.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After making these assumptions, we can calculate the steady states by findins
 the intersections of the lines.
 The next steps is discussing how 
\series bold
inequality
\series default
 affect economic growth by the mechanism of poverty trap (according to this
 model).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The innovation in this model is to take poverty traps and discuss inequality
 based on them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Robustness and Endogenous Wages
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Rancom shocks happen when a fraction of individuals who invested / did not
 invest in human capital become skilled / unskilled workers.
 In most cases having random shocks does not matter, as they don't have
 an important effect - which is not the case here.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Why is a poor country poor? - Because there are 
\series bold
many 
\series default
poor people.
 A large supply of unskilled workers pushed their salaries down (in rich
 countries the opposit is true - even unskilled workers get a decent salary).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\series bold
amplifying effect
\series default
 provides multiple steady states, provided by the 
\series bold
random shocks
\series default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For example, when the wage of the unskilled workers randomly increase -
 the poverty trap might be escaped.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The bottom line: If the economy starts with a low fraction of unskilled/skilled
 workers, it is likely to lead to a steady state in which everyone is skilled/un
skilled.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Poverty Traps and the Microfinance Disappointment
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One of the reasons of poverty is the lack of access to credit.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Hope
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thousands of NGOs have been established arouns the worlds to offer the poor
 billions of dollars in affordable interest rates, in order to significantly
 reduce poverty - based on the hope that the problem is only in the credit
 constraints.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Disappointment
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There were no significant levels of productive investmens.
 Opportunities tended to be turned down, high return projects were avoided.
 The average business remained small, while the consumption borrowing was
 encouraged (increasing debt).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Mechanics of Poverty Traps
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The investment today depends on the income today, and the investment today
 creates more income in the furute (both functions are monotonically increasing,
 with the first one being linear for simplification and the second one is
 concave).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The standard modelling in economics does 
\series bold
not
\series default
 create a poverty trap with this reasoning.
 To get a poverty trap, an 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

S-shaped
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 function is required, which is introduced by modifying the production function:
 there is a range of 
\series bold
increasing
\series default
 marginal product, which 
\series bold
decreases
\series default
 afterwards.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Nutrition example: poor people don't have enough money to buy food, thus
 they work less and earn less.
 In practice there is a consensus that this model is not true (calories
 are extremely cheap, and even proteins).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The problem with this approach is that poor families do not invest enough
 in health and nutrition of their children, leading to less healty individuals.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Though, recent research suggests then the evidence is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset


\series bold
inconsistent with technology-based (fixed costs) poverty traps)
\series default

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Writing down an S-shaped production function is unusual.
 An alternative model (Piketty) relies only on the interaction between the
 wealth distribution and the equilibrium 
\series bold
interest rate
\series default
, without using 
\series bold
threshold effects
\series default
 in wealth accumulation.
 Yet his model relies on a non-convex techology as well.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A possible fix can be made by introduction of an S-shaped saving rate (wealthier
 people save a higher fraction of ther income).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Moving from the older literature (where the emphasis was mainly on 
\series bold
technology
\series default
), the modern papers look more at how people 
\series bold
behave
\series default
 (consumption, self-control issues, etc).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Consider 2 identical economies with the exact same parameters, and same
 average income, with the only difference being the initial distribution
 (economy A has higher inequality).
 In the long-run, economy B would be richer.
 
\series bold
Equality (of wealth) creates equal opportunities
\series default
, which allows families that are above the threshold to converge to the
 reach state.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
People sometimes do not invest in human capital, although it is an efficient
 investment, because of credit constraints.
 According to this model, 
\series bold
under some parameters, 
\series default
equality is good for growth.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Whether there is a threshold at all - is a debatable topic.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
The 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Big Push
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Theory
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This theory is based on similar says that poverty 
\series bold
could
\series default
 by eliminated in the world, only generousity is needed for that.
 There are many doubtful examples: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

the green revolusion
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 for food production, vaccinations, oral rehydration, etc.
 In practice thie theory rsulted with spending of huge amounts of money,
 with disappointing results.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Their is a gap between the intentions of a rich country and the actual results.
 There is a lot of criticism of this theory, for example: it tries to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

plan
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 the economy from above, ignoring information and incentives.
