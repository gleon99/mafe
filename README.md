# MAFE Lecture Notes

These are my lecture notes of the [M.A Financial Economics Program](https://www.idc.ac.il/en/schools/economics/graduate/pages/main.aspx) in IDC Herzliya, attended during 2020-2021.

The notes are written in [LyX](https://www.lyx.org/), which can be used to compile the .lyx files to .pdf (or some other formats).
